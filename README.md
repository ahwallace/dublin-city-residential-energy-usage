# Mapping Dublin Cities Residential Energy Usage

Energy usage data comes from Dublin City Council (DCC). Data can be found [here](https://data.smartdublin.ie/dataset/dcc-residential-energy-per-each-small-area). The data represents the annual residential energy usage (Kwh) by DCC small area, collected during the CSOIreland Census 2016 (dataset created on 2016-05-11).

Used R to source DCC small areas geometry data from CSOIreland's PxStat API. Information for CSOIreland's R package, csodata, is available [here](https://github.com/CSOIreland/csodata).
